# Installing on the Xbox, and getting the game onto it

What works, what doesn't, and why, from getting XI on Xbox running on an Xbox One X in Developer
Mode (September 2026, console OS 26100 `xb_flt_2608ge`). The commands are `tools/xbox.py`, which
runs on any computer on the console's network (it was written on a Mac) and talks to Device Portal.

## The setup that works

The app is registered as a **loose app** from the console's development drive, and the game sits
next to it:

```
D:\DevelopmentFiles\LooseApps\XIonXbox\
    AppxManifest.xml, XIonXbox.exe, resources.pri, Assets\
    AppxMetadata\CodeIntegrity.cat          <- the exe's catalog; the console won't start it without one
    SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI\            <- the player's install, 65k files, about 14 GB
```

The shell looks for the game beside the app (`PackagedGameFolder()` in `shell/GameCopy.cpp`), so no
setting is needed. The game is uploaded once. An update replaces the exe and its catalog, which is
about 45 MB, and never touches the game.

```
XBOX=<console address> python3 tools/xbox.py setup build/XIonXbox-xbox.msix "<...>/FINAL FANTASY XI"
python3 tools/xbox.py deploy build/XIonXbox-xbox.msix      # every build after that
python3 tools/xbox.py logs <folder>                          # host64.log, app.log, samples.bin
python3 tools/xbox.py status                                 # what's on the console
```

`deploy` and `setup` take the **app-only** package (`deploy-xbox.ps1 -PackageOnly`), not
`XIonXbox-with-game.msix`.

## The console's two drives

| drive | what | size |
|---|---|---|
| `U:` | user data: every app's `LocalState` (`U:\Users\UserMgr1\AppData\Local\Packages\XIonXbox_...`) | **about 3.2 GB free** |
| `D:\DevelopmentFiles` | dev-mode apps: installed packages (`WindowsApps\`) and loose apps (`LooseApps\`) | large; holds the game |

**The game does not fit in LocalState.** The app's "Copy the game from a computer" (`GameCopy.cpp`,
from `tools/serve_game.py`) copies into LocalState. On this console it shows about 2.9 GB free of
3.2 GB and can't finish. It may work on a console with a bigger user partition. It doesn't here.

## What didn't work

| approach | result |
|---|---|
| The package with the game (`package-with-game.ps1`, 15 GB), through Device Portal's **Add page in a browser** | The upload failed every time. |
| The same package, **streamed** (`tools/xbox.py install`) | Works: the upload takes minutes, then the console installs for **30–60 min** (it checks all 66k files at about 8 MB/s). Every update is another 15 GB, and a lower-version or loose app can't replace it later. |
| **Register from a network share** (Dev Home / Device Portal, `\\<mac>\share`) | `0x80073CF0` "Failed to register package", with both macOS File Sharing and Samba. The console connected, signed in, read `AppxManifest.xml` in full and closed it without an error, then gave up. It never opened the exe. The cause is unknown. The same small layout registers fine from `LooseApps`. |
| The app **reading the game straight off an SMB share** (`game.txt` = `\\host\share\...`) | The app shows "cannot open that FINAL FANTASY XI folder (error 65)" (`ERROR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED`). No connection reached the server: the app sandbox refuses before sending anything. The `enterpriseAuthentication` capability and a guest-readable share didn't change that. |
| The game in **LocalState** (the in-app copy, or Device Portal uploads) | Doesn't fit on `U:` (above). |

## Quirks, and what `tools/xbox.py` does about them

**Launching**
- **The loose folder needs `AppxMetadata\CodeIntegrity.cat`, and it must be the one built with that exe.**
  Without it the app registers fine but won't start: Dev Home says **"Please try again"**, and Device
  Portal's launch returns `0x80070002`. After replacing the catalog, **register again**. `deploy` does both.
  Windows desktop doesn't enforce this, so `deploy.ps1`'s loose layout isn't a guide here.
- After registering, check that the app's type is **Game** in Dev Home (View details). As an App it gets
  about 1 GB of RAM. It hasn't been checked whether re-registering resets it.

**Registering**
- **A loose app can't replace an installed package**, or the reverse: `0x80073CFB` "An unpackaged version
  cannot replace this" (and the reverse message). Uninstall first (`tools/xbox.py uninstall`).
- **Uninstalling left LocalState in place on this console** (settings, `USER`, shader cache, even an old
  `game.txt`). `uninstall` still backs it up to `build/` first.
- Registering the same version again works, and a lower one might not. `deploy` writes the **registered**
  version into the manifest, since builds from `deploy-xbox.ps1` may carry a lower one.
- Loose registration is `POST /api/app/packagemanager/register?folder=<base64 of the LooseApps subfolder>`,
  then poll `/api/app/packagemanager/state`: it returns 204 while working, then a JSON `Success` / `Reason`.

**Device Portal's file API** (`/api/filesystem/apps/...`, known folders `DevelopmentFiles` and `LocalAppData`)
- Every write needs the `CSRF-Token` cookie from an earlier response echoed as an `X-CSRF-Token` header.
- A POST with no body needs `Content-Length: 0`, or IIS answers 411.
- **Uploads don't create folders.** Uploading into a missing folder returns 500 "The system cannot find the
  path specified" / "File move failed". Make each folder first (`POST .../folder?path=<parent>&newfoldername=<name>`).
- **Listing a folder that doesn't exist returns an empty list, not an error.**
- **LocalState doesn't exist until the app's first run.** Before that, uploads to it fail with a 500 and
  `mkdir` returns 200 without making anything. Launch the app once.
- Deleting a folder, with everything in it: `DELETE .../folder?path=<parent>&filename=<folder name>`.
  With `path=<the folder itself>` it answers 400 "Missing fileName".
- A file is fetched with `GET .../file?path=<folder>&filename=<name>`.
- **A rebuilt file can keep its size.** `CodeIntegrity.cat` is 1764 bytes build after build, so a push
  that skips same-size files skips it. `deploy` sends every app file.
- LAN speed was about 10–30 MB/s for large files and much slower for small ones. The first game upload took
  about 40 minutes. `game` resumes: run it again and it sends only what's missing.
- **Leave the local game folder where it is until an upload finishes.** Moving it mid-push makes every
  remaining file fail ("No such file"). Running it again from the new place resumes.
- `FINAL FANTASY XI\TEMP` holds logs the game writes on the computer. `game` doesn't send it.

**Which game folder the app uses** (`LoginScreen.cpp`): `LocalState\game.txt` if present, else the game beside
the app, else the one used last, else a LocalState copy, else the build's default. **A leftover `game.txt`
overrides the game beside the app**; `status` flags it, and `tools/xbox.py rm local:\LocalState game.txt`
removes it. A leftover `LocalState\SquareEnix` from an unfinished in-app copy uses up the small drive;
remove it with `tools/xbox.py rmdir local:\LocalState SquareEnix`.

**Space**
- Updating an installed package left the old version's folder (with its 14 GB) under
  `D:\DevelopmentFiles\WindowsApps\XIonXbox_0.2.0.0_...`. `status` lists these. Removing them through Device
  Portal hasn't been tried.

## Error codes seen

| code | where | meaning here |
|---|---|---|
| `0x80073CF0` | registering from a network share | The package couldn't be opened. See above; use `LooseApps` instead. |
| `0x80073CFB` | registering a loose app over a package (or the reverse) | Uninstall the other one first. |
| `0x80070002` | launching through Device Portal | Here: no `CodeIntegrity.cat` in the loose folder. |
| "Please try again" | launching from Dev Home | Same as above. |
| error 65 (`ERROR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED`) | the app opening a `\\server\share` game folder | The sandbox blocks it; no fix found. |
| HTTP 411 | Device Portal POST without a body | Send `Content-Length: 0`. |
| HTTP 500 "File move failed" | Device Portal upload | The target folder doesn't exist (or LocalState isn't made yet). |

## Logs

The app writes to its LocalState: `host64.log` (every `[app]`, `[lsb]`, `[recomp]` and `[gfx]` line),
`app.log` (the shell), and, with profiling on, `samples.bin`. `tools/xbox.py logs <folder>` copies them.
`samples.bin` has to be read against the linker map of **the same build** of `XIonXbox.exe`:
`FFXIRecompile/tools/sample_report.py samples.bin <exe.map>`. That map is on the machine that built the exe.
